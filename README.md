## Request Joomla! Marketing support

If you need marketing support from the MWG you can use the links below to request support, share your ideas, request imagery, etc... You do need a GitHub account, if you don't have one you can **[create](https://github.com/join)** one.

Just a few pointers :

1. **If you ask support for an event (Joomla!Day, external, JUG meeting,...) please always mention date, location, number of attendees, needed materials**
2. Try to give us as much information as possible
3. If deadlines are applied do not forget to mention them
4. Provide links if possible or screenshots/images
